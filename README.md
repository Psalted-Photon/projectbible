## Quick Start

**Production App (Svelte):**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev:polished      # Port 5174
```

**Development App (Vanilla TS):**
```bash
npm run dev:pwa           # Port 5173 (includes DevTools)
```

**Run Both:**
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

**Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build:polished
```

## 📘 Technical Specification

**For complete architectural details, data models, invariants, and constraints, see:**

### **[PROJECT_SPEC.md](PROJECT_SPEC.md)** ← Authoritative technical specification

The spec includes:
- **System architecture** — Dual PWA strategy, monorepo structure, platform abstraction
- **Data models** — IndexedDB schema v18, pack formats, reading plans with catch-up overlays
- **Features** — 2-dropdown navigation, consolidated packs, translation tree search
- **Constraints & decisions** — Immutable packs, overlay-based adjustments, 2GB SQLite limit
- **Future work** — Electron app, sync system, English morphology filters

**When working with AI assistants, use this command:**

```
Use PROJECT_SPEC.md as the authoritative description of the system.
Do not contradict or revert anything documented there.
```

## Development

**Where Development Happens:**

- **Codespaces/Cloud:** Core logic, PWA, pack tooling, docs, tests
- **Desktop:** Electron packaging, SQLite performance, offline map work, GIS processing

**Key npm Scripts:**

```bash
npm run dev:pwa           # Development app (port 5173)
npm run dev:polished      # Production app (port 5174)
npm run dev:all           # Run both apps concurrently

npm run build:pwa         # Build development app
npm run build:polished    # Build production app

npm run packs:list        # List all packs
npm run packs:promote     # Promote pack (workbench → polished)
npm run build:all-packs   # Build all packs from source data
```

## Features Overview

### 2-Dropdown Navigation
Streamlined navigation using Translation selector + Book/Chapter tree. Swipe gestures on mobile.

### Consolidated Packs (6 total, 3.87GB)
- `translations.sqlite` (33.69 MB) — KJV, WEB, BSB, NET, LXX2012
- `ancient-languages.sqlite` (67 MB) — Hebrew OT, Greek NT/LXX with morphology
- `lexical.sqlite` (365.32 MB) — Strong's lexicons, 470k+ English words, thesaurus
- `study-tools.sqlite` (3.57 MB) — Maps, cross-references, chronology
- `bsb-audio-pt1.sqlite` (1.76 GB) — Genesis–Psalms audio
- `bsb-audio-pt2.sqlite` (1.65 GB) — Proverbs–Revelation audio

### Reading Plans with Catch-Up Adjustments
