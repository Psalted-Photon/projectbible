🏺 Ancient Texts & Manuscripts
These are gold for your ancient-languages.sqlite pack:

Tischendorf 8th Edition — public domain

Westcott & Hort — public domain

These expand your ancient-language capabilities dramatically.

📚 Lexical & Linguistic Data
Perfect for lexical.sqlite:

MorphAdorner Lemma Lists — public domain lemma + POS data

Etymology datasets — several public domain English etymology lists exist

Greek & Hebrew frequency lists — public domain academic datasets

These would make your lexicon pack insanely powerful.

🗺️ Geography & Maps
For study-tools.sqlite:

OpenStreetMap extracts for ancient regions (public domain)

Pleiades Gazetteer — CC BY, ancient world places

OpenBible.info  locations — CC BY

Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire — CC BY

You can generate:

Gregorian chant recordings (PD archives)

You can create optional “audio add‑ons” without licensing issues.

Topic modeling datasets — PD LDA topic sets for the Bible

Named entity recognition datasets — PD biblical NER corpora

These unlock:

semantic search

concept maps

topic clustering

All offline.
